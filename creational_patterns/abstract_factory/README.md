# Abstract factory pattern

## Introduction
Is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. The Abstract factory pattern helps in creating a system that is independent of how its object are created, composed, and represented.
