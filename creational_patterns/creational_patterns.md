# Creational Design Patterns in Python

## Introduction
Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns provide various ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using the `new` operator. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

## Types of Creational Patterns

### 1. Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### 2. Factory Method
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

### 3. Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 4. Builder
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### 5. Prototype
The Prototype pattern  Creates new objects by copying an existing object, avoiding the overhead of creating objects from scratch.
